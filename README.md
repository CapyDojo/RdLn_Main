## Overview

RdLn™ is a sophisticated document comparison tool designed for legal professionals and organizations requiring precise document analysis. Built with React, TypeScript, and modern UI technologies, it provides client-side document processing with complete confidentiality.

## ✨ Latest Updates - Version 0.2.6

### SSMR Refactoring Program (Steps 1-7B) ✅
- **🏗️ COMPONENT MODULARIZATION**: Complete extraction of layout components for better performance
- **📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION**: Dedicated mobile and desktop layout components for enhanced customization
- **⚡ PERFORMANCE GAINS**: ~350 lines extracted from ComparisonInterface, reduced DOM complexity
- **🛡️ SSMR METHODOLOGY**: Safe, Step-by-step, Modular, Reversible approach with zero breaking changes
- **📊 MONITORING INTEGRATION**: Multi-layered performance tracking with memory usage monitoring

### Recent Updates - Version 0.2.5
- **🌊 Waterfall Theme Selector**: Elegant cascading hover effect with physics-based animations
- **🎨 AUTHENTIC PREVIEWS**: Theme cards display using actual colors and styling
- **✨ 3D ANIMATIONS**: Cards "waterfall down" with bounce physics and "roll back up" in reverse

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Unified Redlining**: Official production red/green color scheme across themes
- **Professional Document Comparison**: Myers algorithm-based diff engine optimized for legal documents
- **OCR Integration**: Multi-language optical character recognition with 50+ language support
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, professional interface with consistent visual effects
- **Client-Side Processing**: Complete confidentiality with no server uploads
- **Performance Optimized**: Chunked rendering for large documents (500k+ characters)
- **System Protection**: Smart resource management prevents browser crashes

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **ComparisonInterface**: Main orchestration component (streamlined with extracted layouts)
- **DesktopInputLayout**: Desktop side-by-side input layout with shared resize handle
